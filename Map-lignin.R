# The following script will create the map to be used in the lignin manuscript.
# It will use the sf package rather than creating the map by hand in powerpoint.

# Note - USAboundariesData package is a little out of date so may need to use the following command to install it in the console:
# install.packages("USAboundariesData", repos = "https://ropensci.r-universe.dev", type = "source")
