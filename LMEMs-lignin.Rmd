## Linear Mixed Effect Models

This document was last updated on JANUARY 20, 2020.

This is an R Markdown document that will walk through all of the LMEMs run for Chapter 3 of my dissertation and the resulting manuscript.

```{r data and packages, include=FALSE}

master <- read.csv("RAPID_Master_Datasheet_add_region_streamcode.csv") # Loads the newly updated dataset, as of April 8, 2019. 

#Some of the column headers have been changed, including the ones containing the "micro" symbol, which R apparently cannot process. 
#LTER_Site column - added so that naming convention is consistent, especially among stream sites which were entered differently in the "Site" column.
#Group_2 column - added to split reef sites into groupings near and far from streams by date. 
#Group_3 column - added to create regions from west to east as discussed with Matthieu.

# TOMORROW: I need to deal with NAs vs 0s, as well as cells that <0.01.

```

This is the end of the RMarkdown document.
